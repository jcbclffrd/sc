Based on the paper's methods:

1. Bulk RNA-seq:
   - SMARTer Stranded Total RNA kit
   - 100bp paired-end reads
   - Illumina NovaSeq S4
   - Expected in SRA: 200bp total (100bp R1 + 100bp R2)

2. Single-nucleus RNA-seq (10x Chromium v3):
   - 10x Chromium Single Cell 3' v3 platform
   - 100bp paired-end sequencing
   - Should have: 28bp (16bp barcode + 12bp UMI) + 91bp cDNA
   - Expected in SRA: Could be 208bp if both reads combined, OR properly split

3. Single-nucleus ATAC-seq:
   - 10x Chromium Single Cell ATAC platform
   - 100bp paired-end sequencing
   - Different library structure than RNA-seq
